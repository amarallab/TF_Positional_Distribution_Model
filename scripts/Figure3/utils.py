    This function defines the cumulative positional distribution of TF binding
    events in a genome as defined by the two-state model. The total number of
    binding events occuring within a distance (x) of TSS is a sum of biologically
    relevant binding and spurious binding.

    TSS for a TF.

    from TSS.
